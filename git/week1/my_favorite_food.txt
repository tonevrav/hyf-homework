Something VERY tasty.

Ingredients:

2 large sweet potatoes
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup chopped pecans
Mini marshmallows (optional)

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Peel and dice the sweet potatoes into cubes.
In a large bowl, mix together the diced sweet potatoes, brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg until the sweet potatoes are evenly coated.
Transfer the sweet potato mixture into a greased baking dish.
Sprinkle chopped pecans evenly over the top.
Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown.
Optional: Add mini marshmallows to the top during the last 5 minutes of baking for an extra gooey topping.
Serve hot and enjoy!
