Something tasty.

2 ribeye steaks
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup beef broth
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)
Instructions:

Season the ribeye steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the steaks to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or until desired doneness. Remove steaks from skillet and set aside to rest.
In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sliced mushrooms. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until mushrooms are softened.
Pour in beef broth, heavy cream, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine.
Allow the sauce to simmer and thicken for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Return the cooked steaks to the skillet, coating them with the mushroom sauce.
Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until steaks are heated through and sauce has thickened further.
Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.
Serve the steak hot with a generous spoonful of mushroom sauce on top.
Enjoy your delicious steak dinner!
